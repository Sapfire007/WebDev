        <h2>Interschool events</h2>
        <div>
            During my academic years at Modern Public School, I actively participated in various <b>interschool competitions</b>, notably in <b>Scrabble and Debate</b>. My involvement in the Scrabble competition not only honed my linguistic skills but also developed my strategic thinking. On the other hand, participating in the Debate competition enhanced my public speaking skills and critical thinking abilities. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my intellectual curiosity and communication skills. They have also instilled in me a competitive spirit and the ability to work under pressure, qualities that I carry forward in my personal and professional life.

        <i>Things I got to learn from these events :</i>
        <dt><h4>Teamwork</h4></dt>
        <dd>
            In the interschool debate competition, my partner and I learned the importance of teamwork. Effective communication and trust were key. We developed a system of cues for smooth transitions and built trust to rely on each other's judgement during high-pressure moments. This experience significantly shaped my approach to team settings.

        <dt><h4>Strategics</h4></dt>
        <dd>
            Participating in the Scrabble event fostered a competitive spirit and enhanced my communication skills. Interacting with opponents required strategic thinking and clear articulation of thoughts. This competitive environment, coupled with the necessity for effective communication, contributed significantly to my personal and professional development.
