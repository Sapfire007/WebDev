        Hey! Today we are going to learn about CSS
    </div>
    <div>
        The colour of the content within the div tag is due to CSS
    </div>
    <span>
        The content within span tag is also affected due to the same CSS styling
    </span>
    <p> Content within the paragraph tag remains unchanged because it is not specified within CSS </p>
