            Chandannagar (pronounced [tʃɔnd̪ɔn.nɔɡoɾ]; French: Chandernagor, pronounced [ʃɑ̃dɛʁ.nagɔʁ]), also known by its former names Chandernagore and Chandernagor, is a city in the Hooghly district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is headquarter of the Chandannagore subdivision and is part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).

         Located on the western bank of Hooghly River, the city was one of the five settlements of French India. Indo-French architecture is seen in the colonial bungalows, most of which are in a dilapidated state.[1]
